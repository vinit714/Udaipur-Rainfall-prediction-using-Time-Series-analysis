# Udaipur-Rainfall-prediction-using-Time-Series-analysis
In this project we see time series analysis Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to predict the rainfall in Udaipur district of Rajasthan, India.

# Problem Statement
This study carried out to Udaipur district of Rajasthan. Udaipur receives maximum rainfall due to the south-west monsoon in monsoon season and in all other seasons rainfall is very low for this area. Hence there is always a wide variation in daily annual rainfall as well as seasonal rainfall.

# Objective
Perform time series analysis Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) to predict the rainfall.

# Dataset
Rainfall data:
* Recorded monthly
* Measured in millimeters (mm)
* Starting Date : 01-01-2010
* End Date : 01-12-2020
* district : Udaipur

The dataset taken from knoema https://knoema.com/aulvzxc/district-wise-rainfall-data-for-india?regionId=IN-RJ

# Pipeline of the Project
* Visualize the time series
* Stationarize the series
* Plot charts and find optimal parameters
* Build the ARIMA model
* Make prediction

# Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model

The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method models the next step in the sequence as a linear function of the differenced observations and residual errors at prior time steps.

It combines both Autoregression (AR) and Moving Average (MA) models as well as a differencing pre-processing step of the sequence to make the sequence stationary, called integration (I).

# Output

We expect to predict rainfall of Udaipur of near future
